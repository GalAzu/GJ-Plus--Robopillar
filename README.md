# RoboPillar
At the Game Jam Plus in December 2022, I was fortunate to be part of a small international team that developed a game inspired by the movie Wall-E. The game tasks players with cleaning a desolate earth in a survival gameplay, and its themes of environmental responsibility and resource management aim to spark reflection. While I am humbled by the positive reception, I also hope that this game will inspire players to take action in their own lives. This project has been a wonderful learning experience, and I am grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with talented individuals from around the world.
